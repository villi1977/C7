.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBvzquota\fP controls disk quotas for Virtuozzo/OpenVZ container.
These are per-container disk quotas set from Virtuozzo/OpenVZ host system.

The \fIcommand\fR can be one of the following:
\fBinit\fP, \fBdrop\fP, \fBon\fP, \fBoff\fP, \fBsetlimit\fP, \fBsetlimit2\fP,
\fBreload2\fR, \fBstat\fP, \fBshow\fP.

The \fIquota_id\fP must be numeric-only identifier. Note, that quota ID is not
the same as container ID (CTID). One container can mount several filesystems
and each of them can have its own quotas.
.SH OPTIONS

.SS General

.TP
.B -h
Print usage information.
.TP
.B -V
Print utility version.
.TP
.B -q
Quiet mode. Causes all warning and diagnostic messages to be suppressed.
Only fatal errors are displayed.
.TP
.B -v
Verbose mode. Causes \fBvzquota\fR to print debugging messages about its
progress. Multiple \fB-v\fP options increase verbosity. Maximum is 2.
.TP
.B -b
Batch mode. in this mode outputs (usually on \fBstat\fP and \fBshow\fP
commands) will be in format better suitable for parsing by a script.

.SS Quota Commands

The following commands are available:
.TP
.B init
A necessary preliminary for any other quota command work: create a new
quota file, calculating current disk usage from given path.
This command requires full set of quota soft- and hardlimits given
as command-line options. Limits are also stored in quota file, so
subsequent \fBvzquota on\fP doesn't requires any quota limit as
command-line parameter, although accepts them as well. New specified
limits and flags will also be stored in the quota file.

You can also create your own quota files for arbitrary quota accounting points.
Quota file location and path to quota accounting point can be specified via
\fB-c\fP and \fB-p\fP options (see below). You can use also \fB-R\fP option
instead of \fB-c\fP option, to set relative quota file location. In this case
quota file resides one dirrectory upper than quota accounting point and has
special name (see below).
.TP
.B drop
Remove quota file. Command checks if quota is running and refuses to remove
file in this case, option \fB-f\fP allows to override that rule.
.TP
.B on
Turn quota on. If previous quota session wasn't switched off properly
(quota is not running, but quota file indicates it is),
initialization procedure will be performed. \fB-f\fP option allow to force
initialization procedure regardless of the shutdown status. Command \fBon\fP
doesn't work in case specified quota id is running.
.TP
.B off
Turn quota off, write usage statistic back to the quota file. Doesn't work
if quota file cannot be accessed, also accepts \fB-f\fP option
(force switching off, even if usage statistic will be lost). This is possible
that quota will still be in a stopped state, even if \fB-f\fP flag is used.
.TP
.B setlimit
Set new quota parameters. Requires at least one quota parameter or flag
specified. Applies new parameters immediately if quota with given quota_id
is running. Stores new limits and flags in the quota file. Option \fB-f\fP
specifies to mark quota as dirty, so at the next quota start, disk
will be rescanned and usage updated.
.TP
.B setlimit2
Set second-level quota parameters. Applies new parameters immediately
if quota with given quota_id is running and second-level quota is
on. Stores new limits in the quota file.
.TP
.B reload2
Reload second-level quota limits from quota file for given quota_id.
.TP
.B stat
Show usage statistics and update it in quota file. Option \fB-f\fP causes to
do not read and update quota file, just print statistics from kernel.
Option \fB-t\fP specifies to show and update user/group based quota statistics
for a container. Works on running containers only. The command with \fB-t\fP
option flushes all quota statistics from kernel to file and thus may be used for
backup purposes.
.TP
.B show
Show usage and limits info from quota file. Option \fB-t\fP specifies to show
user/group quota information as well.

.SS Setting quota limits

All these options are required in \fBinit\fP command, and optionally
accepted in \fBon\fP and \fBsetlimit\fP commands.
.TP
.BR \-s ,\  --sub\-quotas\ 1 | 0
Enables or disables user/group based quota inside the container. Here \fB1\fP
means to enable, and \fB0\fP - to disable.
By default user/group quota is disabled. This option is accepted by
\fBinit\fP, \fBon\fP and \fBsetlimit\fR commands.
.TP
.BI \-u\  user_id
For \fBsetlimit2\fP command only. Limits will be applied to the specified
\fIuser_id\fP.
.TP
.BI \-g\  group_id
For \fBsetlimit2\fP command only. Limits will be applied to the specified
\fIgroup_id\fP.
.TP
\fB\-u\fR, \fB--ugid\-limit\fP \fIlimit\fP
For \fBon\fP and \fBsetlimit\fP commands only.
Specifies maximum number of user and group IDs allowed in the container.
If the value is \fB0\fP, user/group quota will not be accounted.
Default value is \fI0\fP. There is one note concerning \fBsetlimit\fP command.
If first-level quota is running, second-level quota is active
and not all ugid objects were loaded into kernel by \fBon\fP command due to
insufficient \fIugid_limit\fP value (this can be checked by issuing
\fBstat -t\fP command and observing whether ugid limit was exceeded),
then \fBsetlimit\fP with new \fIlimit\fP value updates it in kernel and
file but this change does not take immediate effect. Modification will be
applied after quota restart.
.TP
\fB\-b\fR, \fB--block\-softlimit\fP \fIbsl\fP
Disk quota block soft limit.
Soft limit is amount of blocks which excess is allowed in time equal
\fIexptime\fP.
On the expiration of this time soft limit becomes hard limit.
Block limits are set in 1k sized blocks.
.TP
\fB\-B\fR, \fB--block\-hardlimit\fP \fIbhl\fP
Disk quota block hard limit. Hard limit is amount of blocks which excess is not
allowed.
.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB--block\-exptime\fP \fIbet\fP
Disk quota expiration time for excess of a block soft limit.
Time can be given in two different formats:
.br
1. \fIdd:hh:mm:ss\fP
.br
For instance: \fI30\fP - 30 seconds; \fI12:00\fP - 12 minutes; \fI20:15:11:00\fP - 20 days, 15 hours, 11 minutes
.br
2. \fIxxA\fP, where \fIA\fR - h/H(hour); d/D(day); w/W(week); m/M(month);
y/Y(year).
.br
For instance: \fI7D\fP - 7 days; \fI01w\fP - 1 week; \fI3m\fP - 3 months
.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB--inode\-softlimit\fP \fIisl\fP
Disk quota inode soft limit. Similarly to block soft limit.
.TP
\fB\-I\fR, \fB--inode\-hardlimit\fP \fIihl\fP
Disk quota inode hard limit.
.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB--inode\-exptime\fP \fIiet\fP
Disk quota expiration time for excess of a inode soft limit.

.SS Other options
.TP
.BI \-p\  path
Point of quota accounting for given \fIquota_id\fP. This option required for
\fBinit\fP command and can be used also with any another command to override
quota path obtained from quota file. For \fBon\fP and \fBsetlimit\fP commands,
this option can be used to set and save new quota accounting path for given
\fIquota_id\fP
.TP
.B \-R
Set special relative path to \fIquota_file\fR. If this option is specified,
quota file location will depends on path to quota accounting dir: if your quota
accounting path is /path/to/\fIsomewhere\fR/ than quota file will be
/path/to/quota.\fIsomewhere\fR. If this option is not specified, quota file
location is /var/vzquota/quota.\fIquota_id\fP. All commands accept this
option.
.TP
.BI \-c\  quota_file
This option allows to specify a \fIquota_file\fR to work with.
All commands accept this option. If this option is not specified, default
file location depends on whether \fB-R\fP option is specified or not
(see above).
.TP
.B \-f
Force option. Accepted by \fBdrop\fP, \fBon\fP, \fBoff\fP, \fBstat\fP,
\fBsetlimit\fP and \fBsetlimit2\fR commands. Action of this option differs
for different commands and is described above for each command separately.
.TP
.B \-t
For \fBstat\fP and \fBshow\fP commands only. Processes user/group quota
statistics. Specifies whether to show (update in file) user/group
quota information.
.TP
.B \-t
For \fBsetlimit2\fP command. Set second-level quota time grace parameters.
.SH LIMITATIONS
It is impossible to start or stop quota accounting if the directory
given by \fB-p\fP option is busy. This is rather limitation of kernel
part of disk quota implementation.
.SH DISPLAY
\fBvzquota stat\fP and \fBvzquota show\fP display the following information:
.TP
.B resource
Either 1k-blocks or inodes.
.TP
.B usage
Current usage of resource.
.TP
.B softlimit
Resource limit. Current usage can exceed this limit up to hard limit during grace time.
.TP
.B hardlimit
Resource limit. Current usage can't exceed this limit.
.TP
.B grace
During this amount of time usage can exceed softlimit. If
a soft limit has not been exceeded the grace column is blank. If the grace
period has expired, the grace column contain special \fBnone\fP value.
.PP
In case option \fB\-t\fP is specified, the following information is
also displayed:
.TP
.B User/group quota:
Status of the 2nd level quota. This can be \fBon\fR or \fBoff\fR,
\fBactive\fR or \fBinactive\fR. Values \fBon\fR/\fBoff\fR define the state
of the 2nd level quota at the next start of container quota.
Values \fBactive\fR/\fBinactive\fR indicate the current state
of the 2nd level quota in the kernel.
.TP
.B Ugids:
Three values are shown: \fIloaded\fP, \fItotal\fP and \fIlimit\fP.
\fIloaded\fP is the number of records (uids or gids) in the kernel.
\fItotal\fP is the number of unique records located in the kernel
and quota file.
\fIlimit\fP is the current kernel limit of records amount.
Note that \fIloaded\fP and \fItotal\fP may be greater then \fIlimit\fP.
.TP
.B Ugid limit was exceeded:
Can be \fByes\fR or \fBno\fR. \fByes\fP indicates that vzquota did not loaded
all records into the kernel. In this case you should reduce the number
of unique records (remove files which belong to unnecessary users)
or increase the ugid limit. After that you should restart quota.
.TP
.B User/group grace times and quotafile flags:
Grace times and quota file flags (internal parameters of standard linux kernel
quota v.3).
